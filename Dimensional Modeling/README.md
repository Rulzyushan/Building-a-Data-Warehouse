The optimal schema design for an operational information system implemented in a relational database is one that adheres to the third normal form (3NF) or follows the entity-relationship model [3, 4]. Such a design ensures efficient and consistent handling of atomic transactions, enabling high-performance insertion, deletion, and updating of data [3, 4]. Operational systems, often referred to as online transaction processing (OLTP) systems, rely on this schema design to maintain predictability and reliability in managing real-time transactional data.
